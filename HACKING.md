## Setup [↑](#table-of-contents)

A quick foreword:
- If you don't use a tool to manage multiple ruby versions, please [install rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- Some packages must be installed using your system's package manager
- You can find some platform-specific documentation for [Mac](wiki/osx.md) and [Ubuntu](wiki/ubuntu.md)

Install the global dependencies:
- ruby (2.3.0) -> [installation](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- bundler -> `gem install bundler`
- postgresql
- yarn -> [installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Install the *optional* global dependencies (to get going faster, skip this for now):
- phantomjs (intially optional, needed for specs / scraping)
- redis (intially optional, needed for background jobs)

Install local ruby dependencies with bundler:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Install local JS dependencies with yarn:

```sh
$ yarn
```

Copy over the development .env file:

```sh
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

Make **sure** Postgres is started, and then setup the local database:

```sh
$ rails db:reset
```

## Development [↑](#table-of-contents)

### Rails

Start the server with:

```sh
$ rails s
```

You can re-seed the database to get fresh (fake) data at any time using:

```sh
$ rails db:reset
```

If you're working on a background job and want it to actually run, make **sure** redis is is started and then run:

```sh
$ bundle exec sidekiq
```

You can use the rails console to explore the database through using [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html):

```sh
$ rails console
```

You can use the interactive debugger [pry](http://pryrepl.org/) to set breakpoints and explore the code at runtime:

```ruby
def method
  binding.pry # <- breakpoint, like 'debugger' in javascript
end
```

Before pushing anything, please make sure to run the linter and tests using `rake`.

```sh
$ rake
$ rubocop -a # if rubocop fails, this fixes any possible linter issues
```

### Client

Make sure the Rails server is started. Then start the [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to serve the javascript app on http://localhost:8080/:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

We use [flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/getting-started/) to statically type-check our javascript. It's recommended that you use an editor that integrates with nicely with flow to get real time errors. Atom (with the Nuclide plugin) is a [good candidate](https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/).

## Testing [↑](#table-of-contents)

We have relatively complete test suites for both the backend and client. Please be sure to add specs for any new features.

### Rails

Rails tests are written using [rspec](http://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/v/3-5/docs), and live under the `spec` directory.

Run all the specs using the rake task:

```sh
$ rails spec
```

Or run individual spec files using the `rspec` directly:

```sh
$ rspec spec/jobs/import_hearings_job_spec.rb
```

Many editors also have a rails-rspec plugin that will let you run specs from your editor, run just the example under your cursor, etc. If you're into that kind of thing.

### Client

Client tests are written using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html), and live in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the files they test. Please add specs for any new features.

Run all the tests using the yarn script:

```sh
$ yarn test
$ yarn test:watch # re-runs as files change
```

Running individual specs is easiest using Jest's path filter (hit `p`) in watch mode.

## Hosting / Deployment [↑](#table-of-contents)

The application is hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/legislated). When a commit is pushed to master, it is automatically deployed to our staging server. When a commit is pushed to production, it is automatically deployed to our production server.

You can interface with the remote apps, their databases, etc. by installing the Heroku [toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install). However, in order to access our app, you'll need to ask somebody to make you a collaborator.

Once that's set up, you can connect a Rails console to explore the Heroku app's data:

```sh
$ heroku login # enter your credentials
$ heroku console -a legislated-staging
```

## Architecture [↑](#table-of-contents)

If you've never worked with some of the technologies on this project, it may be worth reading up on them. Here's a rough breakdown the application architecture and major technologies:

### Rails

#### [Web Server (Rails)](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)

Rails is a web-application framework, and we use it so serve our API, interact with the database, etc. If you've never worked with it, their documentation is a good place to start.

#### [API (GraphQL)](wiki/api.md)

Our API is built using GraphQL, a query language that is an alternative to REST. It offers a lot of flexibility to clients by allowing them to specify the exact data fields of the response. It's also simple to implement on Rails side. See the link for more info.

#### [Data Import (Sidekiq, Capybara)](wiki/import.md)

We use Sidekiq to scrape data nightly from Illinois government websites and throw it in our database. Sidekiq provides a queueing system, built on top of Redis, for running the import jobs in the background.

### Client

#### [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

If you don't know React, it's recommended that you read their docs or pair-program with someone who already knows it. The rest of the client is going to build on top of it.

#### [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/getting-started.html)

Relay is a library that allows React components to declarative specify the data they depend on from a remote GraphQL API. It provides automatic data synchronization and caching.

#### [Flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/getting-started/)

Flow is a relatively unobtrusive static type checker for JavaScript. The reasons for using a type-checker are beyond the scope of this document. If you're familiar with static typing, the linked intro should be enough to get you going.

If you're not, the easiest way to get started is probably to pair program with someone who is. However, don't worry about it too much; it's more important to get started hacking. Write your code without types and we can help retrofit it into your PR afterwards.
