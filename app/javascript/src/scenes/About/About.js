        Legislated has been developed by a
        {' '}<Link to='https://chihacknight.org'>Chi Hack Night</Link>{' '}
        breakout group to make it easier for Illinois residents

        We are a group of volunteers who want to make civic engagement
        at the state level more user-friendly. We try to make it easy for
        Illinois residents to voice their opinions on proposed legislation
        via witness slips.
